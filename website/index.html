								<h2>A little bit about me <br />
								and my background</h2>
							</header>
							<p>Born and raised in Westchester County, NY. I am an avid technology enthusiast with a focus in computer hardware. I grew up always playing video games and decided to implement that passion into my higher education. I graduated, with honors, from the State University at Albany (SUNY) with a Bachelors of Science in Informatics (Cyber Security Concentration).<br>Scroll down to learn more!</p>

								<h2>My interests and characteristics</h2>
							</header>
							<p>These icons arent just random icons (even though they look so), they resemble vital aspects of my life and what I am as a person. the first are brackets, these resemble my ability to code in a few programming languages. These languages include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AngualrJS, Python, PHP, etc. Next is a bolt, this resembles the fast pace enviroment I thrive in. I've always had the work ethic that you have to be moving to be working and this bolt resembles that. </p>
							<p> Next is the house which might sound cheesy but it is a big part of my life. I've always had the feeling that home is where you feel most comfortable and where you shouldn't be stressed out. Next is the gear icon, which resembles my interest in tinkering and taking things apart. I've always, since I was a kid, took electronics apart and tried to put them back together (even though it didn't go so well all the time.) This translated into my extreme passion for building custom computers and diving into the technology world. </p>
							<p>After that is the computer screen which goes along with my passion for technology. This resembles my passion for the online community. What this means is that I enjoy meeting new people that you would never meat anywhere else. Twitch is the main source for a vast amount of the friends I have today. This aspect of Twitch allows people from all around the world become friends without having the ugly aspect of physical appearance to hinder the true meaning of Twitch, which is community. Finally, there is the calendar which is to show how I strive to be punctual and always organized. This is something that everyone should strive for as being on time for anything in life is of utmost importance.</p>
